"Put your head on my shoulder Hold me in your arms Baby, squeeze me, oh, so tight Show me that you love me too",1
"Cause I'm off my face, in love with you I'm out my head, so into you And I don't know how you do it But I'm forever ruined by you",0
Fly me to the moon Let me play among the stars Let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars,0
I see the crystal raindrops fall And the beauty of it all is when the sun comes shining through to make those rainbows in my mind,1
